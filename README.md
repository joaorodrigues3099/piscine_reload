# Piscine Reloaded Portfolio

## Introduction

**Piscine Reloaded** is a series of C programming exercises designed to reinforce key programming concepts from the **42 School’s Piscine program**. This project provided an opportunity to revisit foundational topics such as loops, conditionals, pointers, and memory management, with a focus on hands-on coding practice.

## What I Learned

Through these exercises, I strengthened my understanding of several core concepts in C programming:

- **File and Directory Management**: Manipulated file permissions and automated file handling tasks through shell scripting.
- **Control Structures**: Applied loops, conditionals, and recursion in various problem-solving contexts.
- **Pointer Operations**: Enhanced my skills with pointers, including memory manipulation and function calls using pointer arguments.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Worked with `malloc` and other memory functions to manage dynamic data structures.
- **Automation**: Created `Makefiles` to automate the compilation process and manage project builds efficiently.
- **File I/O**: Gained experience in handling file input/output operations, including error handling.

These exercises helped me improve not only my coding abilities but also my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and adherence to coding standards.

## Technical Skills

- **C Programming**: Solidified understanding of core C programming principles.
- **Shell Scripting**: Automated tasks using Unix shell scripts.
- **Memory Management**: Managed memory dynamically, avoiding memory leaks.
- **Project Automation**: Utilized `Makefiles` to streamline compilation and project management.
- **File Handling**: Developed techniques for efficient file input/output handling.

## How to Run

To run the exercises, clone the repository and navigate to the relevant directory. Compile and run the C programs with:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
./<output_file>
```

For shell scripts and other tasks, follow the specific instructions in each exercise folder.
