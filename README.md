# Piscine Reloaded Portfolio

## Introduction

**Piscine Reloaded** is a collection of C programming exercises designed to reinforce and deepen my understanding of fundamental programming concepts that I originally learned during the **42 School’s Piscine program**. This repository contains my solutions to these exercises, each of which was created with an emphasis on practice, problem-solving, and code quality.

This journey has helped me revisit essential programming topics such as loops, functions, recursion, memory management, and much more. Below is a breakdown of what I've learned through each of the exercises and the skills I’ve honed along the way.

## What I Learned

### Exercise 00: Directory & File Permissions
- **Key Learning**: Understanding Unix file permissions (read, write, execute) and manipulating them via shell commands.
- **Reflection**: This exercise helped me solidify my understanding of how to interact with the file system using shell commands. I learned how to manage directory structures and set file permissions effectively, which is crucial in real-world system programming.

### Exercise 01: Outputting with Shell (`cat`)
- **Key Learning**: Creating a file and ensuring it outputs specific content using shell commands.
- **Reflection**: A simple but valuable exercise that required me to practice working with standard input and output. I learned to manipulate file streams, a foundational skill for handling files and data in Unix environments.

### Exercise 02: Shell Scripting for Cleaning Files
- **Key Learning**: Writing a script that finds and deletes specific files based on their naming conventions.
- **Reflection**: This exercise taught me how to automate file management tasks using shell scripting, specifically the `find` command. It emphasized the power of automation in development environments.

### Exercise 03: Recursive File Search in Shell
- **Key Learning**: Writing a shell script that searches recursively through directories.
- **Reflection**: I learned the importance of writing efficient scripts that can handle complex file systems. This skill is especially useful when dealing with large codebases where finding specific files quickly is key to improving productivity.

### Exercise 06: Printing the Alphabet in C
- **Key Learning**: Revisiting basic loops and character manipulation.
- **Reflection**: This was a straightforward exercise, but it reinforced the use of loops and function calls. It reminded me of the importance of mastering control flow for effective problem-solving.

### Exercise 08: Handling Conditional Logic
- **Key Learning**: Using conditionals to check for negative values and output corresponding results.
- **Reflection**: This exercise sharpened my skills in conditionals and control structures, which are foundational to writing any program. It also emphasized how simple checks can be used to control program behavior in more complex scenarios.

### Exercise 10: Pointer Manipulation (Swapping Integers)
- **Key Learning**: Swapping two integers using pointers.
- **Reflection**: I improved my understanding of pointers and memory addresses, which are essential in C. Pointers form the backbone of memory management, and learning how to manipulate them is crucial for efficient coding.

### Exercise 12 & 13: Factorial Functions (Iterative & Recursive)
- **Key Learning**: Implementing both iterative and recursive solutions to calculate factorials.
- **Reflection**: This exercise gave me a deep appreciation for recursion. I learned to compare iterative and recursive approaches in terms of readability and performance. Understanding the trade-offs between the two is vital when writing programs that deal with recursion-heavy algorithms.

### Exercise 16: String Length Function (`strlen`)
- **Key Learning**: Re-implementing the standard `strlen` function to understand string manipulation in C.
- **Reflection**: This exercise solidified my understanding of strings in C and their underlying memory representations. I learned how important it is to manage memory carefully in low-level programming to avoid bugs like buffer overflows.

### Exercise 20: Memory Management with `malloc`
- **Key Learning**: Reproducing the behavior of the `strdup` function using dynamic memory allocation.
- **Reflection**: I explored how memory is allocated and managed manually in C, a low-level task that’s critical for systems programming. This knowledge is indispensable when writing optimized programs, ensuring they don’t suffer from memory leaks or unnecessary overhead.

### Exercise 24: Creating a `Makefile`
- **Key Learning**: Writing a `Makefile` to automate compilation.
- **Reflection**: I learned how important automation is in programming workflows. This exercise taught me how to create `Makefiles` that can streamline the compilation process, ensuring consistency and efficiency when working with larger projects.

### Exercise 27: File Handling and I/O
- **Key Learning**: Reading from and writing to files.
- **Reflection**: This exercise introduced me to the core concepts of file handling in C, which is essential when building systems that interact with the operating system or store data persistently.
