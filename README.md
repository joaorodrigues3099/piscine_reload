# Piscine Reloaded Portfolio

## Introduction

**Piscine Reloaded** is a collection of C programming exercises aimed at reinforcing the programming skills I developed during the **42 Schoolâ€™s Piscine program**. This project helped me solidify my understanding of foundational programming concepts such as loops, recursion, pointers, and memory management.

Each exercise focuses on a specific concept, allowing me to improve my coding style, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail.

## Key Learnings

### Exercise 00: Directory & File Permissions
- Learned about Unix file permissions and how to manipulate them via shell commands. 

### Exercise 01: Outputting with Shell (`cat`)
- Practiced creating a file that outputs specific content when accessed through shell commands, refining my skills in file handling.

### Exercise 02: Automating File Cleanup
- Wrote a shell script to automate file cleanup, which improved my understanding of shell scripting and file system management.

### Exercise 06: Printing the Alphabet
- Reinforced basic loop structures and character handling in C by printing the alphabet.

### Exercise 08: Conditional Logic
- Implemented logic to determine whether an integer is positive or negative, honing my use of conditionals in C.

### Exercise 10: Pointer Manipulation
- Developed a deeper understanding of pointers and how to manipulate them by swapping two integers.

### Exercise 12 & 13: Iterative and Recursive Factorial
- Explored both iterative and recursive approaches to solving problems, gaining insight into their performance differences.

### Exercise 16: String Length Function (`strlen`)
- Recreated the `strlen` function, which helped improve my understanding of string handling and memory representation in C.

### Exercise 20: Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Worked with dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`) to recreate the `strdup` function, enhancing my ability to manage memory in low-level programming.

### Exercise 24: Creating a `Makefile`
- Automated the compilation process using a `Makefile`, learning how to manage project builds efficiently.

### Exercise 27: File I/O Operations
- Developed a deeper understanding of file input/output by implementing a function to display the content of a file.

## Technical Skills Developed

- **C Programming**: Enhanced skills in core concepts like pointers, memory management, and recursion.
- **Shell Scripting**: Improved efficiency in writing scripts for automating file handling and task execution.
- **Problem Solving**: Gained experience in solving algorithmic challenges through both iterative and recursive approaches.
- **Automation**: Learned to streamline the build process with `Makefile` and automate routine tasks in a Unix environment.
- **File I/O**: Strengthened the ability to manage file input/output, including error handling and edge cases.

## How to Run

Clone the repository and navigate to the relevant exercise directory. Compile and run C programs as follows:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
./<output_file>
```

For exercises involving shell scripts or other utilities, refer to the specific instructions in each folder.
