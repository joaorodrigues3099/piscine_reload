# Piscine Reloaded Portfolio

## Introduction

**Piscine Reloaded** is a collection of C programming exercises designed to reinforce and deepen my understanding of fundamental programming concepts that I originally learned during the **42 School’s Piscine program**. This repository contains my solutions to these exercises, each of which was created with an emphasis on practice, problem-solving, and code quality.

This journey has helped me revisit essential programming topics such as loops, functions, recursion, memory management, and much more. Below is a breakdown of what I've learned through each of the exercises and the skills I’ve honed along the way.

## What I Learned

### Exercise 00: Directory & File Permissions
- **Key Learning**: Understanding Unix file permissions (read, write, execute) and manipulating them via shell commands.
- **Reflection**: This exercise helped me solidify my understanding of how to interact with the file system using shell commands. I learned how to manage directory structures and set file permissions effectively, which is crucial in real-world system programming.

### Exercise 01: Outputting with Shell (`cat`)
- **Key Learning**: Creating a file and ensuring it outputs specific content using shell commands.
- **Reflection**: A simple but valuable exercise that required me to practice working with standard input and output. I learned to manipulate file streams, a foundational skill for handling files and data in Unix environments.

... (and so on)

## Technical Skills Developed

- **C Programming**: Deepened my knowledge of core C programming constructs such as pointers, arrays, functions, and memory management.
- **Shell Scripting**: Improved my skills in writing efficient shell scripts for file manipulation and task automation.
- **Debugging**: Gained experience with common debugging tools and techniques for identifying issues in low-level code.
- **Code Efficiency**: Learned how to write clean, efficient, and optimized code, particularly with recursion, loops, and conditional statements.
- **Automation**: Developed skills in automating tasks using `Makefiles` and shell scripts, a crucial part of software development pipelines.
- **File I/O and Permissions**: Gained practical knowledge of working with files, directories, and their permissions in Unix-like systems.

## Conclusion

Completing the **Piscine Reloaded** exercises has been a highly rewarding experience. It allowed me to revisit essential programming concepts while also gaining deeper insights into more advanced topics. Each exercise was an opportunity to refine my coding style, improve my problem-solving abilities, and expand my knowledge of the C programming language.
